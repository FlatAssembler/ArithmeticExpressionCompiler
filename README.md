# ArithmeticExpressionCompiler
A compiler for my own simple low-level programming language, built in JavaScript using the Duktape framework.

See this link for more information: http://flatassembler.000webhostapp.com/compiler.html

"ArithmeticExpressionCompiler.zip" contains the 32-bit Windows executables. The source code is available at: https://flatassembler.000webhostapp.com/Duktape.zip

The file "compiler.html" contains the not-minified JavaScript of the file "compiler.js", present in those ZIP archives and necessary for ArithmeticExpressionCompiler to work.

I've made a YouTube video about how you can set up a modern computer to program it in your own programming language, you can see it here: https://youtu.be/N2C1i8CW7Io

"trigonometry.c" is an example of how to include assembly code generated by ArithmeticExpressionCompiler into C. In case somebody fails to compile it, I've included the 32-bit Windows executable ("trigonometry.exe"), the 32-bit Linux executable ("trigonometry.elf") and 64-bit Linux executable ("trigonometry.elf64"), your computer can hopefully open at least one of them.
