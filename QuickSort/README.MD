This is an example of how to implement the QuickSort algorithm in AEC. "qsort.c" contains the equivalent C code, while "qsort.adb" contains the equivalent ADA code. In case somebody fails to compile the ADA code, "qsortInAda.elf" is a 32-bit Linux executable, "qsortInAda.elf64" is a 64-bit Linux executable and "qsortInAda.exe" is a 32-bit Windows executable compiled with default settings on GNAT 9.2, hopefully at least one of them helps.

"qsort.aec" contains the AEC source code. "qsort.asm" is the output produced by the compiler I made. "qsort.exe" is the executable produced by FlatAssembler from "qsort.asm". "qsort.aec.rtf" contains the syntax-highlighted code exported from Notepad++. "qsort.s" is the assembly code generated by CLANG, it's comparable to "qsort.asm" when the pre-processor variable "ispisPoruka" is defined to be 0.

"qsort.cpp" calls the C++ "sort" function in a way that we can fairly compare the speeds.
