# ArithmeticExpressionCompiler
A compiler for my own simple low-level programming language, built in JavaScript using the Duktape framework.

See this link for more information: https://flatassembler.github.io/compiler.html (The back-end of the website doesn't work now when the website is hosted on GitHub, but the core of the compiler is written in JavaScript and is still usable)

"ArithmeticExpressionCompiler.zip" contains the 32-bit Windows executables of the compiler and some example programs. The source code is available at: https://flatassembler.github.io/Duktape.zip

The file "compiler.html" contains the not-minified JavaScript of the file "compiler.js", present in those ZIP archives and necessary for ArithmeticExpressionCompiler to work. The "control.js" file shows a primitive way to deal with "If", "Else", "EndIf", "While" and similar directives, it's also present in the ZIP archives and necessary for ArithmeticExpressionCompiler to work.

I've made a YouTube video about how you can set up a modern computer to program it in your own programming language, you can see it here: https://youtu.be/N2C1i8CW7Io

"trigonometry.c" is an example of how to include assembly code generated by ArithmeticExpressionCompiler into C. In case somebody fails to compile it, I've included the 32-bit Windows executable ("trigonometry.exe"), the 32-bit Linux executable ("trigonometry.elf") and 64-bit Linux executable ("trigonometry.elf64"), your computer can hopefully open at least one of them.

"NppSyntaxHighlightingScript.xml" is a script for Notepad++ to syntax-highlight that language.
