A compiler for my own simple low-level programming language, built in JavaScript using the Duktape framework.

See this link for more information: http://flatassembler.000webhostapp.com/compiler.html

The file "compiler.html" contains the not-minified JavaScript of the file "compiler.js".

I've made a YouTube video about how you can set up a modern computer to program it in your own programming language, you can see it here: https://youtu.be/N2C1i8CW7Io
