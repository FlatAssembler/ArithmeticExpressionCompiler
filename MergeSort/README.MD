This is an implementation of MergeSort in AEC. The source code is "msort.aec", the assembly code generated by ArithmeticExpressionCompiler is available in "msort.asm", and the 32-bit Windows executable generated by FlatAssembler is available as "msort.exe".

"msort.c" is supposed to be the equivalent C code, while "msort.adb" is supposed to be the equivalent Ada code. As somebody will likely have problems compiling Ada code, I've included 32-bit and 64-bit Linux executables, "msortInAda.elf" and "msortInAda.elf64". "msort.s" is the assembly code generated by CLANG, it's comparable to "msort.asm" when the pre-processor variable "ispisPoruka" is defined to be 0.

"tester1.cpp" and "tester2.cpp" are programs that were used to measure the performance of different implementations of efficient sorting algorithms.
