So, this is a seminar I've made for my Algorithms and Data Structures class about this project. I've made it in LibreOffice, and exported it into many different file formats, hopefully your computer can usefully open at least one of those files.

If you really can't open any one of those files, try viewing the document exported to HTML: https://flatassembler.github.io/QuickSort/seminar.html

"PojednostavljeniSeminar.*" files are a simplified version of the seminar, intended to be possible to understand by people who are not well-versed in informatics.
