This is an implementation of MergeSort in AEC. The source code is "msort.aec", the assembly code generated by ArithmeticExpressionCompiler is available in "msort.asm", and the 32-bit Windows executable generated by FlatAssembler is available as "msort.exe".

"msort.c" is supposed to be the equivalent C code, while "msort.adb" is supposed to be the equivalent Ada code. As somebody will likely have problems compiling Ada code, I've included 32-bit and 64-bit Linux executables, "msortInAda.elf" and "msortInAda.elf64". "msort.s" is the assembly code generated by CLANG, it's comparable to "msort.asm" when the pre-processor variable "ispisPoruka" is defined to be 0.

"tester1.cpp" and "tester2.cpp" are programs that were used to measure the performance of different implementations of efficient sorting algorithms.

"parallel_msort.c" is my attempt at implementing optimal MergeSort that will run on as many CPU cores as it can at the same time using POSIX, "parallel_msort.elf" is its 32-bit Linux executable, while "parallel_msort.elf64" is its 64-bit Linux executable. "parallel_msort.cpp" is my attempt to do the same using C++11 standard library, and "parallel_msort.exe" is its 32-bit Windows executable. I've run into many problems in my attempts to compile them, that's why I've included the executables, so that my potential collaborators don't run into problems if they just want to view them.
