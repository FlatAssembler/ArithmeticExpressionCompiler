This is an example of how to implement the QuickSort algorithm in AEC. "qsort.c" contains the equivalent C code.
"qsort.aec" contains the AEC source code. "qsort.asm" is the output produced by the compiler I made. "qsort.exe" is the executable produced by FlatAssembler from "qsort.asm". "qsort.cpp" calls the C++ "sort" function to directly compare the speeds.
